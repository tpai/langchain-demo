# LangChain Demo

A simple LangChain demo project based on JupyterLab.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install JupyterLab, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check if you have Python 3 installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installing JupyterLab

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can install JupyterLab using the `pip` package manager. To do this, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

This will install the latest version of JupyterLab.

## Running JupyterLab

Once JupyterLab is installed, you can launch it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter lab
```

This will open a new browser window with the JupyterLab interface. From here, you can create and open notebooks, write code, and explore data.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and launched JupyterLab. Now you can start exploring the world of data science and machine learning.
